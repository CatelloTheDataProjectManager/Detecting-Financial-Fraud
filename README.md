# Detecting Financial Fraud with Pandas and Cypher üö®üîç

Utilizing Pandas and Cypher expertise, I've successfully applied these skills to model the graph in real-life scenarios. Entities and relationships central to the fraud detection process are accurately represented as nodes and relationships within the Neo4j graph.

In this context, I will undertake an exploration of the transaction workflow, highlighting the nuanced technical skills required to seamlessly create a graph database.

## Transaction Workflow üè¶

### Project Overview
Welcome to my GitHub page, presenting a project focused on developing a Transactions Database. This comprehensive endeavor covers Database Connection, MySQL Database Creation, and Neo4j Graph Database Integration. 

### MySQL Database Creation
- **Initialization**: Creating database, defining table for financial data.

### Neo4j Database Integration
- **Neo4j Graph Database Connection**: Integration of Neo4j for exploring graph database capabilities.

### Project Components
#### Database Connection and MySQL Operations
- **MySQL Operations**: Connection and execution of SQL queries.
- **Table Creation and Data Insertion**: Creation of tables and insertion of simulated financial transactions.

#### Database Connection and Neo4j Operations
- **Neo4j Operations**: Connection and execution of queries to create nodes representing financial transactions.
- **Transaction Type Labeling**: Identification of unique transaction types and assignment of labels.
